Bottom up approach:

1. Check if each unique option is in the database.
- if an option is in the database, we keep track of its id
- if it isn't, then we create a new option and at this point we know for sure we are going to create a new option set
- in the end we populate a list of option ids. Call it optionids_list.

2. Check if an option set exists that already has exactly these options
"""
select OptionSetID
from OptionSetOption
where OptionID in optionids_list 
group by OptionSetID
having count(*) = len(optionids_list)
"""
- if the above query returns something, then great! record the optionsetid
- if it does not, create a new OptionSet and populate OptionSetOption with (optionsetid, optionid) for optionid in optionids_list.
  If this happens, then we know for sure we are going to create a new question

3. Check if a question with the question text, type, and optionsetid already exists.
- if it does then great, get this questionid
- if it doesn't, create a new question

4. Link the job to the question
- insert (JobID, QuestionID) into JobQuestion
